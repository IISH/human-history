# Big Data in Human History

This association of historical social scientists explores big theoretical and empirical questions on the human past. Its mission lies in pursuing big questions at multiple scales of data and analysis, relying on advanced methods, and assuming interactions throughout the human social system.

## Big Questions 
Theory and hypotheses on dynamics in human society: work, community, exchange, well-being, sustainability, social evolution, social complexity, knowledge, inequality, conflict, rupture, and environmental interactions.

## Multiple Scales 
Working with data and analysis at multiple scales; comparing and linking scales. In time: the contemporary era, the industrial era, the post-1500 era, the era of cities and states, the era of agriculture, human diaspora. In space: from the local to the regional or global; terrestrial or maritime. In populations: from individuals to communities to global society. In topics: ranging across fields of study from society to economics, government, culture, knowledge, health, genetics, and environment.

## Methods informed by Information Science 
Work with digitized data supported by advanced metadata, ontologies, archiving, and curation; it relies on large-scale computation and linked-open data or succeeding methods. Its mission is to pursue big questions about interactions within human social systems, at multiple scales of data and analysis, using methods from information science.



## Conferences
