# Big Data in Human History 

This association of historical social scientists explores big theoretical and empirical questions on the human past. Its mission lies in pursuing *big questions* at *multiple scales* of data and analysis, relying on *advanced methods*, and assuming interactions throughout the human social system.

## Big Questions 
Theory and hypotheses on dynamics in human society: work, community, exchange, well-being, sustainability, social evolution, social complexity, knowledge, inequality, conflict, rupture, and environmental interactions.

## Multiple Scales 
Working with data and analysis at multiple scales; comparing and linking scales. In time: the contemporary era, the industrial era, the post-1500 era, the era of cities and states, the era of agriculture, human diaspora. In space: from the local to the regional or global; terrestrial or maritime. In populations: from individuals to communities to global society. In topics: ranging across fields of study from society to economics, government, culture, knowledge, health, genetics, and environment.

## Methods informed by Information Science 
Work with digitized data supported by advanced metadata, ontologies, archiving, and curation; it relies on large-scale computation and linked-open data or succeeding methods. Its mission is to pursue big questions about interactions within human social systems, at multiple scales of data and analysis, using methods from information science.



## Conferences 
Historical Social Scientists participants have agreed to meet at the Social Science History Association in the U.S. (in odd-numbered years, e.g. 2017, 2019) and at the European Social Science History Association (in even-numbered years, e.g. 2016, 2018)
